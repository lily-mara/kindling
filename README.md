# Kindling

![Example image](./media/example.png)

This is a library for making smart home displays using Rust and Kindles.

This is a Rust HTTP server which produces PNG image data that a Kindle can fetch
via `wget`, then display via `eips`.

## Configuration

You will need to create a config file in the working directory called
`stops.yml`. Look at `stops-example.yml` for an example configuration file.

## Running

You do not need to provide any command-line arguments to the server, just start
it and it will immediately begin listening on port 3001. The server provides the
following HTTP routes:

```
/kindle.png ==> Renders the dashboard formatted for a Kindle display
/stops.html ==> A HTML page that shows the dashboard
/browser.png => Renders the dashboard for a browser (the Kindle image is rotated, the browser image is not)
```

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by [Matt Healy's 2021 blog
post](https://matthealy.com/kindle) on building a smart home display with a
Kindle. Matt used an old Kindle to display things like weather, calendar events,
meal plans, and house cleaning schedules. I figured I could probably adapt his
guide and make myself an always-available display of upcoming transit departures
at the stops nearest to my apartment.
